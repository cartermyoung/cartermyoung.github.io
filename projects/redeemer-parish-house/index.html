            <h2 class="h3 fw-light">Project summary</h2>
            <p>The Episcopal Church of The Redeemer’s project included the renovation of the existing Parish House, built in 1885 and designed by renowned architect Charles M. Burns, the renovation of the attached 19th century Sexton’s Cottage, the demolition of the existing 1955 Parish House addition and, in its place, the construction of a major new three story addition. Paramount during the design and construction of this new facility was the preservation of the historical nature of the existing Parish House and Cottage to integrate it into all of the building’s magnificent new spaces.</p>
