            <h2 class="h3 fw-light">Project summary</h2>
            <p>Construction of three new buildings over an eight year span for the corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities in Hatfield, Pennsylvania (60,000 square feet) and Baton Rouge, Louisiana (20,000 square feet).</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Worked closely with Curtiss-Wright EST Group corporate executives to write and solicit competitive bids from architectural, engineering, construction management, and general contracting firms.</li>
              <li>Developed three different types of RFP’s to be used on the projects dependant on varying construction market economic conditions in two different states.
                <ul>
                  <li>A design/build method of project delivery was used in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</li>
                  <li>A construction management type of contract with a fixed fee and a GMP was used in Hatfield, Pennsylvania on the original plant construction.</li>
                  <li>And a firm price competitive bidding was deemed more appropriate for use on the Hatfield addition that was built.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Handled all aspects of the design and construction administration phases for all three projects, including the authoring of the three different types of the contract agreements.</li>
              <li>Represented Curtiss-Wright EST Group as their owner’s representative during all design and construction meetings at the job sites.</li>
              <li>Reviewed, critiqued, and negotiated all change order requests submitted by the various design and construction teams.</li>
              <li>Carefully inspected the work of all trades to insure quality workmanship, and compliance with the contract documents and local building codes.</li>
              <li>All three projects were completed within the owner’s time and budget requirements.</li>
            </ul>
