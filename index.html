        <p><img alt="Photograph of Carter M. Young" src="/images/homepage/carter.png" style="float:right" width="175">Carter M. Young of Blue Bell, Pennsylvania passed in the presence of his loving wife Tuesday February 7, 2023 after a short illness.</p>
        <p>Born to Roy and Dama (Michael) Young; beloved husband of 52 years to Margaret (Oberlander); loving father to Ryan Young (Katie Trifiletti) and Kirsten Henry (Joe), and dear grandfather to Finnegan Henry.</p>
        <p>Carter was raised in Nazareth, where he attended high school and was a member of the tennis team. He then went on to attend Drexel University of Technology, where he met Peggy and graduated with a Bachelors in engineering. He was also a member of Alpha Pi Lambda fraternity. He served as President his senior year.</p>
        <p>After college, Carter worked for Schaefer and Company for some 35 years and finished his career managing a successful consultancy. He was an owner's representative for many esteemed clients who appreciated and admired his work and advice.</p>
        <p>In his personal life, Carter most enjoyed golf as a 50 year member of Cedarbrook Country Club, where he served as Vice President and held other positions on the Golf Committee. He was also an avid horseman, owning, handicapping, and attending all of the Triple Crown and multiple Breeders Cup events. His other passions included fishing, often bringing home the catch of the day to enjoy with his family.</p>
        <p>Living in the Philadelphia area, it goes without saying that he was a huge fan of the local professional sports teams with a special love of the Eagles. Go Birds. He also followed high school athletics, always keeping up to date with his son Ryan's swim team at alma mater LaSalle College High School but also followed local high school football and wrestling.</p>
        <p>Ask anyone about Carter and most likely their first response will involve his generosity. His heart was bigger than life itself. His first love was the long-running Tee-off Fore the Children at Cedarbrook. The annual golf outing that he started over 40 years ago has raised multiple millions of dollars for his favorite charity, the Committee to Benefit the Children (CBC). This year's event, normally held in July, has already committed to hosting a tree planting ceremony in Carter's honor. He also donated a very generous percentage of his income when consulting with non-profit clients including local Philadelphia area religious and educational organizations.</p>
        <p>Carter was a longtime member of Upper Dublin Lutheran Church and enjoyed donating his time to various construction projects. He was a constant fixture at Sunday services, especially those in their outdoor sanctuary.</p>
        <p>His visitation is 10 AM Friday at Upper Dublin Lutheran Church - <a href="https://udlc.org">udlc.org</a> with a service to follow at 11.</p>
        <p>The interment is private.</p>
        <p>In lieu of flowers, donations are appreciated. Committee to Benefit the Children - <a href="http://cbckids.org">cbckids.org</a></p>
